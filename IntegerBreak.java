        // Given a number n lets say we have a possible product P = p1 * p2 * ... pk. Then we notice what would happen if we could break pi up into two more terms lets say one of the terms is 2 we would get the terms pi-2 and 2 so if 2(pi-2) > pi we would get a bigger product and this happens if pi > 4. since there is one other possible number less then 4 that is not 2 aka 3. Likewise for 3 if we instead breakup the one of the terms into pi-3 and 3 we would get a bigger product if 3*(pi-3) > pi which happens if pi > 4.5.

        // Hence we see that all of the terms in the product must be 2's and 3's. So we now just need to write n = a3 + b2 such that P = (3^a) * (2^b) is maximized. Hence we should favor more 3's then 2's in the product then 2's if possible.

        // So if n = a*3 then the answer will just be 3^a.

        // if n = a3 + 2 then the answer will be 2(3^a).

        // and if n = a3 + 22 then the answer will be 2 * 2 * 3^a

        // The above three cover all cases that n can be written as and the Math.pow() function takes O(log n) time to preform hence that is the running time.
